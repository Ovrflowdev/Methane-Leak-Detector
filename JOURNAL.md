This is my journal of the design and building process of **Low-Cost Methane Leak Detector**.  
You can view this journal in more detail on **Hack Club Blueprint** [here](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/projects/82).


## 10/3/2025 - Starting this project !!!  

Hi !
Here's the first journal entry of this project !
Lemme explain why I wanna do this :
Methane (CH₄) is 80 times more potent than CO₂ in terms of global warming over 20 years. Over 100 years, it remains 28-34 times more potent.
Methane is ~30% of global warming.
Compared to C0₂, methane's lifespan is ~12 years, and CO₂ is 100+. So if we learn how to reduce methane emission **NOW**, then we could quickly reduce global warming and its impact on the environnement.
Getting a classic methane leak detector isn't an affordable thing at all: consumer-grade detectors range from $50-300 but lack precision and mobility, while professional laser-based systems used for industrial leak detection cost $5,000-30,000+. This creates a massive gap - environmental organizations, small farms, or citizen scientists simply cannot afford proper monitoring equipment.

As a first step in this project, I'm beggining to design the device !
I just put the components, but ima cook the connections rn or tomorrow

## 10/5/2025 - Finished designing schematics !  

Hiiii, I just finished the schematics on EasyEDA !
I just gotta check all connections to make sure there's no short-circuits or stuff like this :p

On the following picture, we got
1. USB-C port
2. TP4056
3. DW01A
4. FS8205
5. ON/OFF Switch
6. JST Battery connector
7. AMS1117
8. ESP32
9. ESP32 RESET Button
10. ESP32 BOOT Button
11. MQ-4 (Methane sensor)
12. DHT22 (Temperature and humidity sensor)
13. GPS NEO-M9N (GPS module)
14. LoRa SX1276 (LoRa emmitor for data transmission)
15. Green power LED
16. Yellow alert LED 
17. Charging LED
