## 10/3/2025 - Starting this project !!!  

Hi !
Here's the first journal entry of this project !
Lemme explain why I wanna do this :
Methane (CH₄) is 80 times more potent than CO₂ in terms of global warming over 20 years. Over 100 years, it remains 28-34 times more potent.
Methane is ~30% of global warming.
Compared to C0₂, methane's lifespan is ~12 years, and CO₂ is 100+. So if we learn how to reduce methane emission **NOW**, then we could quickly reduce global warming and its impact on the environnement.
Getting a classic methane leak detector isn't an affordable thing at all: consumer-grade detectors range from $50-300 but lack precision and mobility, while professional laser-based systems used for industrial leak detection cost $5,000-30,000+. This creates a massive gap - environmental organizations, small farms, or citizen scientists simply cannot afford proper monitoring equipment.

As a first step in this project, I'm beggining to design the device !
I just put the components, but ima cook the connections rn or tomorrow
